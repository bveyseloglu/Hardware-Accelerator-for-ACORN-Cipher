## Development Environment
The development environment that used by me in this project is Vivado Design Suite 2014.4 and the hardware description language is VHDL. The ARM processor of the ZedBoard was programmed by using C Language. 

## Important Notice
The hardware architecture is on development and it's not ready to use.

# About the Project
## 1.	Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a ubiquitous term to describe the tens of billions of devices that have sensing or actuation capabilities, and are connected to each other via the Internet. The IoT includes everything from wearable fitness bands and smart home appliances to factory control devices, medical devices and even automobiles. Security has not been a high priority for these devices until now [1].

There has been a lot of discussion regarding the hacking of devices and systems to obtain information and data. However, just as critical are cyber-attacks against the devices themselves - attacks which take over control of the device and cause them to operate in dangerous and insecure ways.
Still, the deployed protective mechanisms must comply with the constrained resources of the target embedded systems. Lightweight cryptography focuses on cryptographic mechanisms suitable for such systems. Lightweight block and stream ciphers are expected to perform well in embedded devices and mainly provide confidentiality and data integrity. Block ciphers are the most common choice in lightweight cryptography as their design is often more straightforward and their security properties are well‚Äêstudied.
In recent years, stream ciphers have gained ground as several research efforts have investigated secure stream cipher designs [3].
